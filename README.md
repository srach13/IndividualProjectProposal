# Sweet Home 3D
## Project Abstract
Designing a house, apartment, or dorm room can be a fun and exciting task, but it can also be daunting and overwhelming. Since it isn't cheap to decorate your living space, you want to make sure you are confident in your design decisions. Sweet Home 3D is an interior design application that lets you draw house plans & arrange furniture. In the application, you can draw walls and rooms, update the colors, textures, sizes and orientations of furniture, walls, floors and ceilings, drag and drop doors, windows, and furniture, and more. You can also download images of what you own and import them into the application. This is an extremely helpful open source project for anyone looking to design their apartment or house.
## Project Relevance
This project is relevant to the educational goals of Graphic User Interface as outlined in CIS 3296. Graphic User Interface is a type of user interface through which users interact with electronic devices via visual indicator representations. This is an important goal because it can drastically improve usability. Graphic User Interface enhances the efficiency and ease of use for users. In addition to supporting the goal of Graphic User Interface, this project is also relevant to the goals of Project Management, Version Control, Testing, and Debugging. Through contributing to this project, my team and I will gain practical application in all these learning objectives.
## Conceptual Design
For my contribution to this project, I will focus on adding more features to enhance the application. For example, I will add more interior design features such as the ability to add a roof, which is currently not available in the current version. I will also contribute by debugging the application as reviewers have mentioned bugs related to importing furniture, customizing colors, etc.
